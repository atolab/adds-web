## Cyclone DDS now available!

As we wait for the [Eclipse IoT](https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/eclipse-cyclone-dds) process to complete, we have decided to
make Cyclone DDS (**cdds**) available so that the community can start engaging with us in building the future of DDS.
In the days the follow we will be releasing some additional contributions, and this is just the beginning of the *cyclone*.

We want as many of you to check out **cdds** on [GitHub](https://github.com/atolab/cdds) and give us feedback and suggestions by [opening an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/atolab/cdds).
